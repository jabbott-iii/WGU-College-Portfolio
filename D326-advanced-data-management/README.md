A.  Summarize one real-world written business report that can be created from the DVD Dataset from the “Labs on Demand Assessment Environment and DVD Database” attachment. 

'There is four months of usable rental data. Since it is less than a year, an annual report will not be possible. A month to month report is possible. Our monthly report will focus on total payments by month and inventory. This will guage monthly profit and indicate what inventory items are more popular.'

1.  Identify the specific fields that will be included in the detailed table and the summary table of the report.




2.  Describe the types of data fields used for the report.

3.  Identify at least two specific tables from the given dataset that will provide the data necessary for the detailed table section and the summary table section of the report.

4.  Identify at least one field in the detailed table section that will require a custom transformation with a user-defined function and explain why it should be transformed (e.g., you might translate a field with a value of N to No and Y to Yes).

5.  Explain the different business uses of the detailed table section and the summary table section of the report. 

6.  Explain how frequently your report should be refreshed to remain relevant to stakeholders.
